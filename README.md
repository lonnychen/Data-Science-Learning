# Lonny's Data Science Learning
This project documents my Data Science learning path startng in April 2021.

**Guiding Documentation:**
1. "Data Science: Concepts and Practice" - Kotu/Deshpande Chapter 3 [amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Predictive-Analytics-Data-Mining-Concepts/dp/012814761X) [official](http://www.introdatascience.com/). I chose this as my main roadmap for learning techniques as it provides just enough theory to point me to the math/stats that I need to learn on the side, and the text itself uses RapidMinder which forces me to learn to implement the techniques myself using the more widely useful Python Data Science libraries in the Jupyter Notebooks environment
2. Materials found in Huy Ngoc Dang's [repository](https://github.com/huydang90/Hertie-School-Data-Science-Society) for the Hertie School Data Science Society for understanding of high level approaches to learning data science as well as detailed technical references, e.g. dealing with missing data, permutation importance.<br>

**Python coding**:
1. [Real Python](https://realpython.com): Well worth the membership fee, particularly the tailored Data Science "Learning Paths"
2. [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/): great articles that both explain the reasoning behind concepts (one-hot encoding, nested cross-validation) and provide reference code for scikit-learn flows

## Structure
Notes and code will be structured by specific tasks or techniques with the following header template:
- Technique
- Guiding Documentation
    - Process
    - Goal
- Idea (in my own words)
- Math
- Dataset(s)
- Python
- Tuning Parameters (<)
- Advantages (+)
- Disadvantages (-)
- Caveats (\*)

Included throughout:
- **Python (- Library)** (key methods/structures used, code references linked)
- **Figure: CORRECT** (results of task/technique goal compared to guidance)
- **Notes** (nuances, caveats)
- **Observations** (data analysis observations)
- **SOLVED!** (Eureka! moments in data science)
- **TO-DO** (further learning/work)

Conventions:
- "per-" means separate analysis
- "by-" analyzed/plotted together but stratified (by colour or otherwise)
